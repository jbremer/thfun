ThFun - pwning your mother since 1998

Our aim in this presentation is to show that security through obfuscation 
can be presented not only through single-flow program which obfuscated
the program control flow, but rather a multi-threaded flow.

In this presentation we present ThFun, a multi-threaded based obfuscator .
ThFun obfuscates program control flow by using a variety of threading tricks 
which involve, but not only, TLS obfuscation , timing attacks, basic block obfuscation,
dynamic return values and more

It is important to understand that nowadays, most - if not all, program obfuscators or program
protectors are based on one control flow, even the top-notch obfuscators which
employ virtual machine obfuscation are one single control and thus it is possible to follow 
the control flow using dynamic taint analysis, symbolic execution or instrumentation.
It is possible to thus achieve one full picture of the code 
and thus pass it into further static analysis engines.

ThFun brings a new method to obfuscate the program by splitting the program into 
several threads which execute different parts of the program's code.
The control flow of the program stays intact to avoid deadlocks and race conditions
however, static analysis or classical used instrumentation methods nowadays will result 
in several (big) control flow which are hard to follow and understand.

The presentation will cover the basic components of the ThFun obfuscator and will
show a few proof of concepts for each method we employ.
